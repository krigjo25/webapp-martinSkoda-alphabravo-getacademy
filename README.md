#   Description

Driving a car game -

On the road random items appears, it can be choosen to add the specsific item into the car or not. Some items increase the cool factor, while other items decrease it. Sometimes a friend or a buddy could appear on the road which has to be greeted before continue the path.

There has to be atleast three ways to greet your boddy, and your buddy would only accept one of those three ways which would be randomized.

If your cool bar is high, then your buddy would want to greet back in a cool way otherwise the buddy will not greet back in a cool way.

Other elements which can be discovered on the way - Use your imagination, maybe an aggressive grandmother - if you hoos to ignore her it will end with an aggresive bulk on the car and it will decrease the coolness factor.

Aim to fill up the cool-o-meeter, when its at 100% the game ends with a congratulation ( or maybe a bossfight if x animals is hitted) "
